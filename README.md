# Project Title

Hey! Welcome to the 'Hearing Aid App' project, where you will find a mobile application designed to improve the communication between hospital staff and hearing-impaired patients
during their visits. This project consists of three major components: the app itself (with the help of Google's speech-to-text software), an external microphone used by the hospital staff,
and an earpiece worn by the patient (which is paired to the mic for the purpose of amplifying the healthcare professional's words). 

## Installation and Setup

No specific instructions. Just make sure you have an IDE that runs Kotlin (i.e., Android Studio) and the application can be run. I recommend leaving all of the settings and configurations
as is. 

## Usage

This application was coded using Kotlin and it consists of two main tabs: the "Translator" tab, and the "Settings" tab. In the "Translator" screen, you can find
a "Speech-to-text" button, which, when pressed, will activate Google's speech-to-text feature. Then, you can freely speak into the microphone and your words will be converted to text.
This text will be then printed in the upper text box that says "Text will appear here." On the "Settings" tab, you will find a drop-down menu which will allow you to select the language
you wish the spoken words to be translated to upon transcription (this is in the case that the doctor only speaks a certain language but the patient can only understand and speak another).
Additionally, you will find an 'Amplification' slider just underneath. The hospital staff attending to the patient will have a microphone which will be paired with an earpiece that the 
patient will use. The 'Amplification' slider will allow the patient to modify the amplification of the sound coming into the earpiece.  

## Features

Includes two input methods by which the patient can gain an improved understanding of the professional's words

- Speec-to-text transcription
- External, wireless earpiece whose amplification can be modified based on user preference
